meta:
  title: PTTI Pathological Case
  output: ptti-pathological
  rseries: true
  tmax:  300
  steps: 300

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    1000
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   10

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta:  0.018

  ## c is the contact rate per day. 13 is an accepted
  ## value on average under normal circumstances.
  c:     13.0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious.
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.0714

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714.
  kappa: 0.03

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.02

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing.
  chi:   0.1

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing.
  eta:   1.0

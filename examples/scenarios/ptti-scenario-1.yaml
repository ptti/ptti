##
## This is Scenario 1: Weak Testing and Isolation with phased lockdown release. 
##   Lockdown lifted in a phased way as per UK government Covid-19 recovery strategy (11th May): 
##   those who can’t work from home encouraged back to work from 13th May, some schools 
##   may open 1st June, some entertainment venues may open 4th July 
##   (the latter both subject to estimates of infections circulating and R)

  start: 2019/12/18
  envelope: false

  steps: 895

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta:  [0.033, 0.036, 0.039]

  ## c is the contact rate per day. 13 is an accepted
  ## value on average under normal circumstances.
  c:     13.0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.
interventions:
  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March. 
  ## Reduce contacts from 10 to 13 per day (by ~25%).
  - time: 89    # 16th March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 10
  ## After one more week, Lockdown, on 23rd March. 
  ## Reduce contacts to 4 per day (~70% reduction).
  - time: 96    # 23rd March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 4
  
  ## On 13th May, start relax lockdown, phase one: 
  ##    those who can’t work from home encouraged back to work 
  ## Contacts per day increse from 4 to 6
  - time: 147
    parameters:
      c: 6

  ## On 1st June, relax lockdown more, phase two
  ##  some schools may open 1st June
  ## Contacts per day increse from 6 to 8
  - time: 166
    parameters:
      c: 8
      
  ## On 4th July, relax lockdown more, phase three
  ##  some entertainment venues may open
  ## Contacts per day increse from 8 to 11
  - time: 199
    parameters:
      c: 11   # assume contacts per day won't go back up to pre-pandemic level of 13

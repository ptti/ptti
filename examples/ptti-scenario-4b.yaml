## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta:  0.0375   # this based on fitting in ukfitting.py

  ## c is the contact rate per day. 13 is an accepted
  ## value on average under normal circumstances.
  c:     13.0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

## below parameters are used in calculation of theta below
    ## default testing rate (proportion of symptomatics)
  tested: 0.8   
    ## 50% of SARS-Cov-2 infected (IU) have symptoms
  symptomatic: 0.5 
    ## average duration of symptomatic illness(coldflu or Covid combined)
  duration: 7
  
## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.

                        # it is divided by duration of symptoms so as to only test each sympomatic 
                        # person once during their illness
            ## Tracing
      chi: 0.8  # 80% of the those who test positive per day have contacts traced
